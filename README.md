# ✈️ Flight Fare Prediction:

This project predicts flight ticket prices using machine learning regression models. It analyzes various features such as airline, source, destination, departure time, duration, and number of stops to estimate fare prices.

## Project Highlights:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Encoding of categorical variables
- Regression model training and tuning
- Evaluation using metrics like R² score and RMSE
- Visualizations for insights and model performance

##  Tech Stack:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

##  How to Run:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sharankumarrevan/Flight-fare-prediction.git
